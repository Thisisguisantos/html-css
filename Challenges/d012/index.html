            I'm getting tired <br>
            of such technology <br>
            Only speak by email <br>
            short and cold message <br>
            Twitter and Facebook <br>
            before i expire <br>
            I will say everything in poetry.

            It's not like it used to be <br>
            It's all abbreviated <br>
            "You" has only one letter <br>
            The "Y" and "O" has been crossed out <br>
            to declare love <br>
            Just put a flower <br>
            And a heart drawn.

            Arroba now doesn't weigh <br>
            Is part of an address <br>
            End point is not used <br>
            Or go to the beginning <br>
            now it's .com <br>
            If the site is very good <br>
            He is worth a high price.

            To make the language worse <br>
            The emoticon is a risk <br>
            There's a symbol for everything <br>
            Semicolon and an asterisk <br>
            a kiss means <br>
            to understand how it is <br>
            Decipher this scribble.

            I miss the cards <br>
            Written by hand <br>
            Sent in June <br>
            only arrived in summer <br>
            But I missed you <br>
            It was real text <br>
            In the lines of the heart.

        <p>
            Now I write and send <br>
            arriving at the same time <br>
            But when will I talk <br>
            the person left <br>
            opened another app <br>
            The world was captive <br>
            From the technology of now.

            Fortunately, to pray <br>
            don't need internet <br>
            God listens to everyone <br>
            If you want, take this test <br>
            Two points are two knees <br>
            Your lips are appliances <br>
            Let God interpret.
